# Homebrew cask for Claudy.
#
# Publishing: copy this file into the `Endikk/homebrew-claudy` tap (Casks/ directory),
# then update `version` AND `sha256` on every release:
#   shasum -a 256 dist/Claudy-<version>.zip
#
# SECURITY: `sha256` must always be pinned (never `:no_check`). It is the only integrity
# check in the chain: the postflight below removes the quarantine flag, so it must only
# ever apply to an artefact whose digest Homebrew has verified.
#
# User install:
#   brew install --cask Endikk/claudy/claudy

  caveats <<~EOS
    Claudy is not notarised by Apple (free project, no paid developer account).
    The cask removes the quarantine flag automatically. The code is open source:
    https://github.com/Endikk/Claudy, build it yourself if you prefer.
